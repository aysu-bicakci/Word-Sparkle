Six-Repetition Principle
The test module in our app uses the "six-repetition principle" to help users retain the words they learn permanently. According to this principle:

Repeated Tests: Each word is presented to the user six consecutive times as a question.

Correct Answer: The user must answer the same question correctly six times.

Incorrect Answers: If the user fails to answer correctly six times, the question resets, and they must answer it correctly six more times.

Transfer to Known Pool: If the user answers the question correctly six times, it is moved to the known question pool.

Review Intervals: Known questions are retested at specific intervals: 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year later. These intervals are optimized to ensure long-term retention in memory.

This principle is an effective method to ensure the long-term recall of learned words.
